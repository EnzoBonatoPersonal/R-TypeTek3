## Norme Commit

On this R-type project, we chose to have a pretty good commit history. For that, we tried to respect a certain pattern which first consist to put your initials between two brackets, then put a keyword choose between EDIT, ADD or REMOVE and finally the origin of the commit. Thanks to this pattern of commit, the history of our commits is clean and we can easily see what each commit did.

Exemple:  
[EB][EDIT] Edit Readme  
[MB][ADD] Add new file for the ECS  
[IB][DELETE] Delete useless files  


## Branches and Merge

During the entire duration of the project, each member of the team worked on differents branches. This was better for the organisation and less dangerous than work all together on the main branch. For the merge, in the beginning, we merged the different branches localy with a backup folder. This is not the right way to do this. This is why after the first month of the project, we tried and we used the pull requests in order to learn about how they work and and with the aim of merge our branch in a better way which is cleaner.
