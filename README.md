This project aims to recreate the [R-Type](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type) game with a multiplayer mode in order to play up to 4 players. For this, we had to implement a multi-threaded server using [Boost::asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) and [Boost::Thread](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/thread.html). For the graphical part, we used the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
Our project is divided into two parts: The Server and the Client both running at the same time.

## Prerequisites

Before launch the compilation, you will need to have on your computer :

C++ Compiler 11.3.0

## Build System

**Linux:**

You can use the install.sh via Terminal Bash to compile our project on Linux:

```
./install.sh
```

**Windows:**

You can use the install.bat via Powershell to compile our project on Windows:

```
.\install.bat
```

## How to use the binaries

**In a Terminal**

```
./r-type_server
```

**In Another Terminal**

```
./r-type_client [NAME]
```

## How to use the Doxygen Documentation

We have a Doxygen Documentation. This is how to use it :

If you want to regenerate the doxygen do this :
- Paste ```apt-get install doxygen graphviz```
- Paste ```doxygen dconfig``` on your terminal
- Go on the ./docs/html/ directory.
- Copy the path of the index.html

Otherwise just do this:

- Go on the ./docs/html/ directory.
- Copy the path of the index.html
- Paste this path on internet and that's it !

## Constraints
